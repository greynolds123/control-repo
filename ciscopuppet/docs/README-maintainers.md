# Maintainers Guide

Guidelines for the core maintainers of the ciscopuppet project - above and beyond the [general developer guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Accepting Pull Requests

* Is the pull request correctly submitted against the `develop` branch?
* Does `rubocop` pass? (This is checked automatically by Travis-CI)
* Is `CHANGELOG.md` updated appropriately?
* Are new Beaker tests added? Do they provide sufficient coverage and consistent results?
* Are the example manifests updated appropriately? Does puppet-lint pass? (TODO - add to CI)
* Do tests pass on both N9K and N3K? (In particular, N3048 often has unique behavior.)
* Review the Gemfile
  * Is the data still relevant?
  * Do the version dependencies need to be updated? (e.g. rubocop)

## Release Process Checklist

### Pre-Merge to `master` branch:

When we are considering publishing a new release, all of the following steps must be carried out (using the latest code base in `develop`):

1. Pull release branch based on the `develop` branch.
      * 0.0.x - a bugfix release
      * 0.x.0 - new feature(s)
      * x.0.0 - backward-incompatible change (if unvoidable!)

1. Run full beaker test regression on [supported platforms.](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-puppet-module#resource-platform-support-matrix)
     * Fix All Bugs.
     * Make sure proper test case skips are in place for unsupported platforms.
     * Ensure that tests have been executed against released Gem versions (release a new version if necessary!) and do not have dependencies on unreleased Gem code.


1. Update [changelog.](https://github.com/cisco/cisco-network-puppet-module/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)
     * Make sure CHANGELOG.md accurately reflects all changes since the last release.
     * Add any significant changes that weren't documented in the changelog
     * Clean up any entries that are overly verbose, unclear, or otherwise could be improved.
     * Indicate new platform support (if any) for exisiting providers.
     * Create markdown release tag.

     * Merge after approval.
     
1. Reach out to PuppetLabs and ask them to verify new release branches (Puppet and NodeUtils) against their CI.
     * **Important** Only after getting approval from puppet, move on to post-merge steps.

### Post-Merge to `master` branch:

1. Create annotated git tag for the release.
     * [HowTo](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging#Annotated-Tags)
