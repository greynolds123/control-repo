shell_config

This is the shell_config module.  It encapsulates the shell_config
type given by Tim Bishop on the Puppet Wiki.  CSAIL staff did not
write this, and MIT has no copyright claims over it.  In fact, we
don't even know what the appropriate license is -- presumably whatever
contributor license was agreed to by Mr. Bishop when posting to the
Puppet Wiki.
