summary "Encapsulates Tim Bishop's shell_config type from the Puppet Wiki"
description "Tim Bishop provided a shell_config type using Augeas
as the underlying mechanism on the Puppet Wiki page for FreeBSD.
It's actually useful for many operating systems that have shell-like
configuration files (we also use it on Debian).

MIT claims no authorship over this module."
