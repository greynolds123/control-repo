## Supported Release 1.0.0
### Summary:
This is the initial release of the rewrite of puppetlabs-pe\_accounts for a more general usage.

Differences from the pe\_accounts module is that the data model is gone, and thus the base class that accepts hashes (ie, from hiera). Instead, the module is designed around the use of the `accounts::user` defined resource.

To regain the old hiera behavior, use the `create_resources()` function in combination with `accounts::user`; eg: `create_resources('accounts::user', hiera_hash('accounts::users'))`
