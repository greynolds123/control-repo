## Need more examples from you!

Samba is a rich but complex piece of software. This module try to leave you enough
hooks to fine tune your samba deployment.

However some good examples beyond basic deployment could be great.
Anything like (but not limited to):
* tunning options
* idmap setup
* printer server setup
* ssl setup in DC mode 
* etc

could be really interesting.

Don't hesitate to do a pull request, your examples will be added or merge with existing examples.
