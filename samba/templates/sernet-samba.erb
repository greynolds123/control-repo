# SAMBA_START_MODE defines how Samba should be started. Valid options are one of
#   "none"    to not enable it at all,
#   "classic" to use the classic smbd/nmbd/winbind daemons
#   "ad"      to use the Active Directory server (which starts the smbd on its own)
# (Be aware that you also need to enable the services/init scripts that
# automatically start up the desired daemons.)
SAMBA_START_MODE="<%= @sambamode %>"

# SAMBA_RESTART_ON_UPDATE defines if the the services should be restarted when
# the RPMs are updated. Setting this to "yes" effectively enables the
# functionality of the try-restart parameter of the init scripts.

# SAMBA_IGNORE_NSUPDATE_G defines whether the samba daemon should be started
